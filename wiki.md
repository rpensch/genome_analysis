# Genome Analysis
## Project Plan
### Introduction
In the course of this project I am aiming to reproduce the results of the following research paper: 

"RNA-seq and Tn-seq reveal fitness determinants of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium during growth in human serum” (2017) by Xinglin Zhang et al. 

*Enterococcus faecium* is a bacterium that normally occupies the human digestive system but can often cause infections of the bloodstream in hospitalized patients. This is dangerous since some strains have acquired resistance against the most common antibiotics. Surviving and thriving in such suboptimal and nutrient-poor conditions as they are in the human blood is a challenge and the mechanisms that make it possible for *E. faecium* are to be analyzed in this study. In a first step, the question whether and how gene expression differs in human serum and conditions of a conventional nutrient-rich growth medium is of interest. This is analyzed by examining the transcriptomes of *E. faecium* grown in both environments. Later, genes that promote growth in human serum are identified by comparing transposon sequencing (Tn-seq) data of transposon mutant libraries of the bacterium from both serum and plain growth medium. 

The data that is available to try and answer these questions is for one sequencing data from Illumina HiSeq 100 bp paired-end sequencing, Pacific Biosciences RS II SMRT technology long-read sequencing and Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION with R7 flowcell chemistry to assemble the genome of *Enterococcus faecium*. Transcriptome data is available from 100 bp paired-end sequencing with the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform and Tn-seq data from 50 nt single-end sequencing with Illumina HiSeq 2500. 

### Methods
The steps and analyses required for carrying out this project successfully will be described below in roughly the order they will be performed.

#### Quality Control:
Before starting the project it is important to make sure the quality of the sequencing data is sufficient to go through with the analysis and figure out where problems might come up at later stages. With Illumina data, this will be done before and after preprocessing, with FastQC which is a quick and simple software for quality control and will provide an overview of the data. PacBio reads will later be assembled with Canu which also includes a quality control step.

#### Preprocessing:
The data I will be working with is already trimmed but might need some more preprocessing. In this case this will be done with Trimmomatic for Illumina sequences which can be used to trim sequencing data and remove adapters. PacBio sequences will be trimmed with Canu during assembly. 

#### Genome Assembly:
In a first step PacBio sequencing data will be assembled using Canu which was developed specifically for the assembly of long reads. The paper reports that this assembly lead to a gap in the assembled genome that could not be closed which is why Illumina and MinION reads will be assembled with Spades in a second step. Spades can deal with various different types of reads at the same time which is why it is a good fit here. Genome assembly is a very time-consuming step. Both steps can take several hours which is why careful planning and execution of these will be crucial in this project. 

#### Assembly Evaluation:
Next, the quality of the assembly needs to be evaluated. Quast will be used to determine the general quality. With MUMmerplot, the two assemblies can be compared by visualizing their whole-genome alignment. 

#### SNP calling:
SNP calling identifies variable sites in the genome and can be carried out with BCFtools which finds SNPs and small insertions and deletions. 

#### Annotation:
Prokka will be used for annotation. It is a software tool for the fast structural and functional annotation of prokaryotic genomes.

#### Synteny Comparison:
ACT will be used for visualiuation and synteny comparison with a closely related genome. 

#### Mapping:
BWA will be used to align paired-end RNA-seq as well as single-end Tn-seq reads to the assembled genome. 

#### Differential Expression Analysis:
Counting the mapped RNA reads for differential expression analysis will be done with Htseq, a Python package developed for exactly this purpose. This is a step that can take up to seven hours for the paired-end reads which will have to be considered. DESeq2 will be used for statistical analysis of the output.

### Timeframe
The official checkpoints for the project are as follows: genome assembly and annotation should be finished by April 17, comparative genomic analyses by April 29 and RNA mapping by May 8 with the final presentations on May 28 and 29. After finishing the plan for the project, work will begin in week 14 which leaves three weeks for assembly and annotation. Since assembly is a step that takes very long and I will be performing it with two different methods enough time should be assigned to complete it. I would like to be done with both methods including quality control and preprocessing at the end of week 15 to have a buffer and enough time to do annotation in week 16. In the following week I will be working on synteny comparison and SNP calling which leaves week 18 and 19 to complete mapping and start differential expression analysis. All analyses should be finished around the middle of week 20 to have enough time to organize and interpret all the results. 

### Organization
Organizing the working directory properly will be important to keep track of the data and all results. I have decided to follow the proposed structure and adjust it if necessary. This means there will be separate directories for analyses, code and data. In analyses, all the steps and methods will have their own folders where files will be numerically organized. Code will also be numerically sorted by method. The data directory will have folders for metadata, raw data and trimmed data.

## Analyses

### Quality Control

Quality control of Illumina raw sequence data was carried out with FastQC. This program provides a quick and simple qulaity check and gives an overview about basic statistics, per base sequence quality, sequence content, GC-content and N-content, per sequence GC-content, sequence length distribution, sequence duplication levels, overrepresented sequences and Kmer-content. For both Illumina files, the quality checks came back very good, there do not seem to be any problems with low quality. According to the results of this quality control with FastQC, preprocessing of the data is not necessary and reads will therefore not be trimmed any further.

### Genome Assembly

The first step in the assembly of the *E. faecium* genome was an assembly of PacBio sequence data with Canu. Canu is specifically designed for the assembly of long PacBio or Nanopore reads and includes a correction and trimming step. This means seperate preprocessing of the PacBio data is not necessary. The genome size of *E. faecium* which needs to be included in the command for this step is derived from appendix 1 and amounts to 3.2 Mbp.

Illumina and Nanopore reads were then assembled together using Spades which specializes in assembling data from different sequencing methods as well as long and short reads in one step. Illumina and Nanopore files were included in the command according to the manual and to reduce running time the Kmer size was set to 55 instead of trying various different ones.
